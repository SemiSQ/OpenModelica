  description: Modelica Corba communication module
 
  RCS: $Id$
 
  This is the CORBA connection module of the compiler
  
  The actual implementation differs between Windows and Unix versions. 
  The Windows implementation and the Unix
  version lies in ./runtime but they use C ifdefs to provide different
  implementation
  
  OpenModelica does not in itself include a complete CORBA implementaton.
  You need to download one, for example MICO from http://www.mico.org.
 
  There exists some options that can be sent to configure concerinng 
  the usage of corba: 
     --with-CORBA=/location/of/corba/library
     --without-CORBA
