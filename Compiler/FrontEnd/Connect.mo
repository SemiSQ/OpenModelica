  description: Connection set management

  RCS: $Id$

  Connections generate connection sets (datatype SET is described below)
  which are constructed during instantiation.  When a connection
  set is generated, it is used to create a number of equations.
  The kind of equations created depends on the type of the set.

  Connect.mo is called from Inst.mo and is responsible for
  creation of all connect-equations later passed to the DAE module
  in DAE.mo."

 Note: this is not the same as inner and outer references.
       A connector is inside if it connects from the outside into a
       component and it is outside if it connects out from the component.
       This is important when generating equations for flow variables,
       where outside connectors are multiplied with -1 (since flow is always into a component)."
