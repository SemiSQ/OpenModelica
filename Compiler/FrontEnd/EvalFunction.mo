  description:  This module constant evaluates InstTypes.Function objects, i.e.
                modelica functions defined by the user.

  RCS: $Id$

  TODO:
    * Implement evaluation of MetaModelica statements.
    * Enable NORETCALL (see comment in evaluateStatement).
    * Implement terminate and assert(false, ...).
    * Arrays of records probably doesn't work yet.
