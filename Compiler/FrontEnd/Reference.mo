uniontype Reference 
"an instance reference.
 there are composite references (qualified) in which the list is more than one identifier. 
 there are simple references (ident) in which the list is one identifier only.
 To resolve a composite reference you need to resolve all the reference nodes in it.
 The modifiers are either instance modifiers (for types) and component selection (for array 
 components).
 Examples: 
   composite type reference: Modelica.SIunit.Voltage(mods) {(id1,IU,U),(id2,IU,U),(id3,IM(mods),U)} 
   composite comp reference: x[1].y.z                      {(id1,IS(1),U),(id2,IU,U),(id3,IU,U)}
 Note: the names of the ids are in the Scopes pointed by Node.scopeId (and is always a full path).
       all reference nodes are added to the graph but only the top one in a composite reference
       is pointed by the instance nodes.
