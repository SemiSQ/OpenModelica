  description: Prefix management

  RCS: $Id$

  When instantiating an expression, there is a prefix that
  has to be added to each variable name to be able to use it in the
  flattened equation set.

  A prefix for a variable x could be for example a.b.c so that the
  fully qualified name is a.b.c.x.

  For utility function, see PrefixUtil.mo "

public import ClassInf;
public import DAE;

The component prefix consist of a name an a list of constant valued subscripts.
The class prefix contains the variability of the class, i.e unspecified, parameter or constant."
