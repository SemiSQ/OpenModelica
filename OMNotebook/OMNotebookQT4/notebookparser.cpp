   /*! \class NotebookParser
    *
    * \brief Used to open a notebookfile.
    *
    * Opens a notebookfile. Note that the parser used to parse
    * Mathematica notebooks is not completley correct. There are a lot
    * of notebooktags that are ignored. Some big things that is not
    * implemented is section counter and hyperlinks. Hyperlinks will
    * maybe be implemented later. For hyperlinks to work a new browser
    * must be implemented supporting opening of new documents. This is
    * not implemented at the time of writing.
    *
    * Those Cell styles that is not implemented could in most cases be
    * implemented using the stylesheet. \see \ref stylesheet.xml for
    * more information about changing a cells style.
    *
    * Here is a list of things that are implemented:
    *
    * \li Comments (**).
    * \li Cell[].
    * \li CellGroupData[].
    * \li List[].
    * \li StyleBox[] - does not care about newlines.
    * \li SuperscriptBox[].
    * \li rule[].
    * \li Some cellstyles, Text, Title, Section, Input, Author.
    *
    * Rules implemented:
    * \li FontSlant
    * \li FontWeight
    * \li TextAlignment
    * \li FontSize
    *
    * Below is some tags and rules that is not implemented. Note that
    * this is just a subset of all tags not implemented. It is far
    * from complete.
    *
    * \li Cellstyles, output.
    * \li Section counter.
    * \li Hard newlines.
    * \li swedish charachters (åäö).
    * \li subscript[] - will be implemented later.
    * \li FormBox - ignored.
    * \li RowBox - ignored.
    * \li TextData - displayed as ordinary text.
    * \li BoxData - ignored.
    * \li ButtonBox - ignored, should implement links.
    * \li FileName[] - ignored.
    * \li RuleDelayed - interpreted as Rule.
    *
    * Some rules not implemented
    * \li InitializationCell
    * \li RGBColor
    * \li CharacterEncoding
    * \li ButtonStyle
    * \li ButtonData
    * \li FontColor
    * \li TextJustification
    *
    *
    * \param filename is the name of the file to be opened.
    *
    * \throws runtime_error if the notebook can not be opened.
