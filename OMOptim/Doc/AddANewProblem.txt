/*! \page pageAddANewProblem How to add a new kind of problem

OMOptim can be extended in different ways.

\section Add a new kind of problem
To add your own kind of problem, one should procede in several steps :

- create MyProblem class, inheriting Problem
- create MyResult class, inheriting Result
- create MyProblemInterface class, inheriting ProblemInterface.

Please note that sometimes, MyResult could be similar to an existing result (e.g. OptimResult). In that case, you don't need to create a new class.
