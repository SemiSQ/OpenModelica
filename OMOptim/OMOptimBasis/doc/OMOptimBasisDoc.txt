OMOptimBasis is a library containing main classes of OMOptim but that can be used in other libraries (e.g. PluginEI).
There is no mention of Modelica in OMOptimBasis. It is focused on ProjectBase class, Problems, Results and ProblemInterface.


\section ProjectBase
Each session of the user corresponds to a project (class ProjectBase). Only one project is loaded at a time. Project instance holds main containers :
	
	- List of problems (class Problems)
	- List of results (class Results)
	- Files paths (project, problems)

It's from Project that main managing functions are called : save, addProblem, launchProblem...

\section Problems
See dedicated page \ref pageProblems.

Problems is a MOVector of Problem.
\subsection Problem
Problem is an abstract class corresponding to all kind of optimization problem we'll could have. Optimization, OneSimulation and future other problems inherit Problem.
Main functions to implement include Problem::launch which perform calculations, loading and saving functions. Lauching a problem should return a result inheriting Result (cf. Problem class).
