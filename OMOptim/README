Libraries and software to install
*************************************

Best solution is to download OMDev and set OMDEV environment variable (cf. www.openmodelica.org).
It will provide you needed libraries and tools (e.g. mingw).

- Install OpenModelica
	: http://www.openmodelica.org/index.php/download
- Download Qt Libraries (version used : 4.7)
	: Qt SDK for windows from http://qt.nokia.com/downloads.
	: You can download mingw prebuild version
	
If you don't have OMDEV
****************************
- Download and install Omniorb (if you don't have OMDEV)
	: http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/
	:  you can download prebuild libraries for mingw
- Download Paradiseo
	: http://paradiseo.gforge.inria.fr/
- Build Paradiseo (Windows, using MinGW in the installer)	

Define the environment
*************************
Define environment variables as below :

QTHOME  e.g. C:\Qt\4.7.2
PARADISEOHOME e.g. C:\ParadisEO
OPENMODELICAHOME e.g. C:\OpenModelica1.5.0\
OMNIORBINCLUDE e.g. C:\omniORB-4.1.4\include\
OMNIORBLIB e.g. C:\omniORB-4.1.4\lib\x86_win32


Compilation using qmake
********************
cd build\
qmake "CONFIG+=release" (or qmake "CONFIG+=debug")
nmake release (or nmake debug)

You can also open .pro file with QtCreator


Dymola
*******
To use Dymola as simulator, be sure to set Dymola executable path in Settings panel (in ModOpt interface itself)

Execution
**********
To be launched, OMOptim.exe needs in its folder some dlls (add letter 'd' at the end for debug version). These libraries can be found in OMDev folder.
- QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll, QtXml4.dll from Qt directory
- omniDynamic414_rt.dll omniDynamic414_rt.dll omnithread34_rt.dll from Omniorb directory
- Qwt5.dll library
- libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll
- libstdc++-6.dll
- mingwm10.dll


Class Documentation
********************
A class documentation is available (while incomplete). It should be built using doxygen. File to compile with doxygen is Doc/Doxyfile
