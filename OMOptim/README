Libraries and software to install
*************************************
- Install OpenModelica
	: http://www.openmodelica.org/index.php/download
- Download Qt Libraries (tested with version 4.6.*, didn't work with 4.7RC, 4.7 untested yet)
	: http://get.qt.nokia.com/qt/source/qt-win-opensource-4.6.2-vs2008.exe
- Download and build GLPK
	: http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/
- Download and install Omniorb
	: http://omniorb.sourceforge.net/
	:  you can download prebuild libraries (omniORB-4.1.4-x86_win32-vs9.zip) if your compiler is win32-2008.
- Download Paradiseo
	: http://paradiseo.gforge.inria.fr/
- Build Paradiseo (Windows, MSVC 2008)
	: open eo.sln and moeo.sln in folders e.g. C:\ParadisEO1.2\paradiseo-eo\build and C:\ParadisEO1.2\paradiseo-moeo\build
	: set (in Release mode) runtime libraries to Multithread DLL (\Md) (project properties, C++, code generation).
	: rebuild eo, eoutils and moeo in release mode

Define the environment
*************************
Define environment variables as below :

QTHOME  e.g. C:\Qt\4.6.2
PARADISEOHOME e.g. C:\ParadisEO
OPENMODELICAHOME e.g. C:\OpenModelica1.5.0\
OMNIORBINCLUDE e.g. C:\omniORB-4.1.4\include\
OMNIORBLIB e.g. C:\omniORB-4.1.4\lib\x86_win32
GLPKLIB e.g. C:\glpk\w32
GLPKINCLUDE e.g. C:\glpk\include


Two ways to compile OMOPTIM

Using qmake
********************
cd build\
qmake "CONFIG+=release" (or qmake "CONFIG+=debug")
nmake release (or nmake debug)

Pure visual studio (probably deprecated in near future)
******************
- Be sure that for all header files of ModOpt project, code generation (properties windows) is set to "ModOpt QT .h".
- At first compilation, moc_*.cpp files will be generated and stored in GeneratedFiles folder.
  Include them in the project and recompile (first compilation should give linking errors because of these missing files)


  
  
Dymola
*******
To use Dymola as simulator, be sure to set Dymola executable path in Settings panel (in ModOpt interface itself)

Execution
**********
To be launched, OMOptim.exe needs in its folder some dlls (add letter 'd' at the end for debug version) :
- QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll, QtXml4.dll from Qt directory
- omniDynamic414_vc9_rt.dll omniDynamic414_vc9_rt.dll omnithread34_vc9_rtd.dll from Omniorb directory
- glpk_4_44.dll from GLPK directory

Class Documentation
********************
A class documentation is available (while incomplete). It should be built using doxygen. File to compile with doxygen is Doc/Doxyfile
