The following step-by-step guides explain how to 
build the OpenModelica release .msi file on Windows 
using the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003

00. Update the version number:
    in trunk/Compiler/runtime/settings.c to "x.y.z"
    in trunk/Examples/*.onb
    in trunk/doc/*.doc + generate .pdfs

01. Please do all the steps in README-WIN32.txt
    Also you need to build the simulation runtime from c_runtime
    To do this you need to open MSYS terminal, go to trunk/c_runtime
    say: make -f Makefile.omdev.mingw 

02. Additional needed files:
    - unpack trunk\Compiler\VC7\Setup\zips\mingw.tar.gz       
      -> to \trunk\build\MinGW
    - unpack trunk\Compiler\VC7\Setup\zips\ModelicaLib.tar.gz 
      -> to \turnk\build\ModelicaLibrary
    - build trunk\OMShell then you will get a file:
      \trunk\OMShell\Release\OMShell.exe       
    - build trunk\OMNotebook then you will get a file:
      trunk\OMNotebook\OMNotebookQT4\Release\OMNotebook.exe
      Also, you need to put these files in the directory:
      trunk\OMNotebook\OMNotebookQT4\Release\  
      QtCore4.dll, QtGui4.dll, QtNetwork4.dll, QtXml4.dll, commands.xml, modelicacolors.xml, stylesheet.xml
      OMNotebookHelp.onb, pltplot.jar (from trunk/Compiler/VC7/Setup/bin/ptplot.jar) 
      
03. Update the version into:
    - documentation
    - *.onb files
    - everywhere you might find it 

04. Open the trunk/Compiler/VC7/omc/omc.snl

05. Build the project Ctrl+Shift+B

06. Open Setup, go to a file, right click on it and say->Properties Window
    Then, click on Setup and in the Properties change:
    ProductName, Title, Version to update version to x.y.z

07. Right Click in Setup choose View->"File System", 
    then go to Application Folder, RightClick -> Properties Window
    change DefaultLocation to c:\OpenModelica[x.y.z]
 
08. Locate Uninstall.bat in the solution, edit it and replace the
    number with the latest product upgrade code.
     
09. Right click on Setup and say Build

10. You get a Setup.msi into trunk\Compiler\VC7\Setup\Release

11. DO NOT FORGET THIS FOR WINDOWS VISTA!!
    For Windows Vista release you have to edit the Setup.msi with Orca.exe:

    http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sdk/update/win98mexp/en-us/3790.0/msisdk-common.3.0.cab
    Go to CustomAction Table and change the action type from 1042 to 3090. 
    This elevates the privileges for the custom action and allows it to run.

That's it,
Cheers,
