How to compile on Linux or Cygwin (all from source)
===================================================

You need:
    cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com) make sure to install gcc, make, readline lib.
    antlr (http://www.antlr.org  - tested on v2.7.2->v2.7.7)
        Note: for newer gcc compilers you might need to add #include <cstring>
              in lib/cpp/antlr/CharScanner.hpp, if you compile antlr from sources.
    rml+mmc (http://www.ida.liu.se/~pelab/rml/)
        Just grab it from subversion:
        svn co https://openmodelica.ida.liu.se/svn/MetaModelica/trunk mmc
        user: anonymous
        pass: none
    rml needs smlnj: http://www.smlnj.org (working version v110.xx) or mlton (mlton.org)
    mico   (http://www.mico.org - tested on 2.3.11, 2.3.12, 2.3.13)
        Note: for newer gcc compilers you might need to add #include <limits.h>
              in orb/fast_array.cc
    sun-java version > 1.4
    gcc      (tested with most of the versions)
    readline & libreadlineX-dev, currently X=5
The latest OpenModelica uses Qt for potting and 3D functionality. You will also need:
    Qt 4.x.x (http://trolltech.com - tested with 4.4.3)
    Coin3D   (http://www.coin3d.org - tested with 3.0.0)
    SoQt     (http://www.coin3d.org - tested with 1.4.1)
        Note: for Ubuntu 8.10 you will need to change the code
              in src/Inventor/Qt/SoQtComponent.cpp from:
               static void delete_dict_value(unsigned long key, void * value)
              to
               static void delete_dict_value(uintptr_t key, void * value)


How to compile on Ubuntu Linux (using available binary packages for dependencies)
=================================================================================

You need:
    antlr
        $ sudo aptitude install antlr libantrl-dev
    rml+mmc see above and:
        $ sudo aptitude install libsmlnj-smlnj
        or if you like to use mlton
        $ sudo aptitude install mlton
    java
        you need to install OpenJDK Java runtime or Sun Java runtime
        $ sudo aptitude install openjdk-6-jre
        $ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-openjdk
        or
        $ sudo aptitude install sun-java6-jre
        $ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun
    Qt+Coin3D+SoQt
        you need readline and Qt dev stuff to compile omc and mosh (OMShell)
        $ sudo aptitude install libreadline5-dev libsoqt4-dev


NOTE:
  We assume you took the source from Subversion in a subdirectory called "trunk".
  If you used some other name, replace "trunk" below with your directory.

Setting your environment for compiling OpenModelica
===================================================
  Set ANTLRHOME to antlr installation, e.g. /usr/local/antlr-2.7.7
  ( Ubuntu: $ export ANTLRHOME=/usr/ )

  Set CLASSPATH for antlr, e.g., $ANTLRHOME/antlr.jar
  ( Ubuntu: $ export CLASSPATH=/usr/share/java/antlr.jar )

  Set RMLHOME to rml installation, e.g. /usr/local/rml/x86-linux-gcc/

  If you plan to use mico corba with OMC you need to:
  - set the PATH to path/to/mico/bin (for the idl compiler and mico-cpp)
  - set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to path/to/installed/mico/lib (for mico libs)
  - set the PATH: $ export PATH=${PATH}/path/to/installed/mico/bin
    + this is for executables: idl, mico-cpp and mico-config

  For the new Qt based plotting functionality you will need to:
  - Set QTHOME to where you compiled Qt 4.x.x
    ( Ubuntu: QTHOME=/usr/ )
        NOTE: if you don't define QTHOME you won't be able to plot
              using plot and plotParameteric but it will work with
              plot2 and plotParametric2 functions.
  - Add coin3d/bin and soqt/bin to the PATH variable
  - Add coin3d/lib and soqt/lib to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable

To Compile OpenModelica
  run:
    $ ./configure --with-CORBA=/path/to/mico (if you want omc to use mico corba)
    $ ./configure --without-CORBA            (if you want omc to use sockets)
  in the trunk directory
  Make sure that all makefiles are created. Check carefully for error messages.

    $ make omc       (to build omc and simulation runtime)
    $ make mosh      (to build OMShell-terminal)
    $ make qtclients (to build Qt based clients: OMShell, ext, OMNotebook)

  After the compilation the results are in the path/to/trunk/build.
  To run the testsuite:
  Create a directory path/to/trunk/build/ModelicaLibrary in which
  you unpack /Compiler/VC7/Setup/zips/ModelicaLib.tar.gz
    $ export OPENMODELICAHOME=path/to/trunk/build
    $ export OPENMODELICALIBRARY=path/to/trunk/build/ModelicaLibrary
    $ make test

How to run
==========
To be able to use OMShell-terminal you must
set the OPENMODELICAHOME environment variable
to point to the root directory of OpenModelica, e.g,
    $ export OPENMODELICAHOME=path/to/trunk/build
Also, you have to set the OPENMODELICALIBRARY environment variable:
    $ export OPENMODELICALIBRARY=path/to/trunk/build/ModelicaLibrary

For debugging purposes it can be useful to start OMShell and omc in two different termnials.
For this use:
trunk/build/bin/omc +d=interactive      (if you configured with --without-CORBA) or
trunk/build/bin/omc +d=interactiveCorba (if you comfigured with --with-CORBA=path/to/mico)

trunk/build/bin/OMShell-terminal -noserv         (if you configured with --without-CORBA) or
trunk/build/bin/OMShell-terminal -noserv -corba  (if you configured with --with-CORBA=path/to/mico)

( The -noserv argument will prevent mosh from starting its own omc in the background )

If you want to change the port number of the socket connection you
will have to do it manually in mosh.cpp and Compiler/Main.mo.

Plotting on Cygwin
==================
To be able to plot in Linux you will have to replace:
    $(OPENMODELICAHOME)/bin/doPlot
with
    $(OPENMODELICAHOME)/bin/doPlot.Cygwin
You can achieve this using:
    $ cp $(OPENMODELICAHOME)/bin/doPlot.Cygwin $(OPENMODELICAHOME)/bin/doPlot
    $ chmod +x $(OPENMODELICAHOME)/bin/doPlot

Here is a short example session.

GENERAL NOTES:
==============
- Fedora Core 4 has a missing symlink. To fix it, in /usr/lib do:
  ln -s libg2c.so.0 libg2c.so
  Otherwise the testsuite will fail when generating simulation code.

- to run models and the testsuite you need to have
  "./" in your $PATH variable.
  In general this is considered in Linux a security threat, so make
  sure you have the "./" LAST in your path, after the normal binary
  directories which should be first.

- On some Linux systems when running simulate(Model, ...) the
  executable for the Model enters an infinite loop. To fix this:
    $ cd /path/to/OpenModelica/c_runtime
    $ emacs Makefile
        add -ffloat-store to CFLAGS: CFLAGS= -ffloat-store ...
    $ make clean ; make
    $ cd ../Examples
    $ ../build/bin/omc sim_dcmotor.mos
