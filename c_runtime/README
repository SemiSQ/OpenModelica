OpenModelica runtime libraries
==============================

This directory contains files for the Modelica runtime
environment. The runtime consists of two libraries, libc_runtime.a and
libsim.a. 

libc_runtime.a
==============
c_runtime is used for executing Modelica functions that has been
generated C code for. It consists of the following files.

boolean_array.*  - how arrays of booleans are represented in C.
integer_array.*  - how arrays of integers are represented in C.
real_array.*	 - how arrays of reals are represented in C.
string_array.*   - how arrays of strings are represented in C.
index_spec.c     - keep track of dimensionsizes of arrays.
memory_pool.c	 - memory allocation for local variables.
read_write.*	 - reading and writing of data to file.
utility.c	 - utility functions


libsim.a
========
libsim.a is the runtime for simulations, it contains solvers and a
main function for the simulation. The following files are included:

simulation_runtime.* 	- Includes the main function, solver wrappers,etc.
daux.f 			- auxilary Fortran functions
ddasrt.f		- DDASRT solver
ddassl.f		- DASSL solver
dlamch.f		- determine machine parameters for solvers
dlinpk.f		- gaussian elimination routines, used by solvers.
lsame.f			- LAPACK axuiliary routine LSAME.

(non-linear solver)
hybrd1.f		- non-linear solver with approximate jacobian
hybrj.f			- non-linear solver with analythical jacobian.
r1updt.f		- helper routines 
r1mpyq.f		- helper routines 
qrfac.f			- helper routines 
qform.f			- helper routines 
hybrd.f			- alternative for non-linear solver..
fdjac1.f		- helper routines 
enorm.f			- helper routines 
dpmpar.f		- helper routines 
dogleg.f		- helper routines
