%% A bibtex file for OpenModelica-related publications
%%
%% Name the key according to openmodelica.org:AUTHOR:PUBLICATION:YEAR
%%   This is to avoid name conflicts with a user's own bibtex file!
%% Good annotations to use are:
%%   doi = {10.3384/ecp11063232}
%%       Many publications want these added. If you are cited and the DOI
%%       exists, people will generally find your paper very easily.
%%   url = {http://example.com/path/to/site}
%%       Use this to point to a website that contains metadata, abstract
%%       and download page, etc for your paper.
%%   pdf = {http://example.com/path/to/paper.pdf}
%%       If you have uploaded only the pdf, use a pdf link
%%   Avoid using note-style annotations for download links in favour of the
%%       above alternatives.
%%
%% Please order publications in descending order (newest first), grouped
%% according to the following sections.
%%
%% Quick search keys:
%% [*1*] Books and theses
%% [*2*] Journal articles
%% [*3*] Peer-Review conference and workshop papers
%% [*4*] Technical reports, etc
