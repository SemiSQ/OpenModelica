This flat modelica parser is since long time deprecated. You probably want to use another modelica parser instead.

-----------------


The flat modelica parser is an adaption of the modelica parser in
antlr for parsing flattened modelica. It is primarily intended for
integration into ModSimPack, hence the modSimPackTest files.

The Makefile is written to work on Solaris with antlr 2.7.1 and gcc
2.95.2. You will probably have to adapt it to your environment.

A current working testfile is testfiles/t.mof. It contains nothing
that the parser does not handle yet.
