Modelica/Mechanics/Multibody/package.mo: and gravityType == 2 then 1 else 0 => gravityType == GravityTypes.UniformGravity
Modelica/Mechanics/Multibody/Parts.mo: rotationType == 1,2 => rotationType == Types.RotationTypes.RotationAxis,TwoAxesVectors

Fixed the following warning:
[libraries/msl31/Modelica/Media/Water/IF97_Utilities.mo:3820:8-3820:9:writable]
Warning: Treating .5132047 as 0.5132047. This is not standard Modelica...

Changed:
- reimplement Functions PackShape and PackMaterial with useful behaviour
Added by Adrian Pop, 2010-09-14
Changed: 
- ModelicaServices/package.mo to include dummy functions PackShape and PackMaterial.
- Modelica/Constants.mo
  final constant Integer Integer_inf=2147483647
  to
  final constant Integer Integer_inf=1073741823
  so we get rid of the MetaModelica maxint warning.
