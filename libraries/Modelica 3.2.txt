Modelica/Media/package.mo Changed nX to : in function ending with X in
PartialSimpleIdealGasMedium to make them have the correct dimensions.

Modified by Martin Sjolund, 2011-05-25
- Fix syntax error (.123 = 0.123)

Added by Martin Sjolund, 2010-10-26
Changed: 
- Modelica/Constants.mo
  final constant Integer Integer_inf=2147483647
  to
  final constant Integer Integer_inf=1073741823
  so we get rid of the MetaModelica maxint warning.
