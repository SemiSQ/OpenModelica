<p>
Partial component to model a <b>sensor</b> that measures any intensive properties
of a flow, e.g., to get temperature or density in the flow
between fluid connectors.<br>
The model includes zero-volume balance equations. Sensor models inheriting from
this partial class should add a medium instance to calculate the measured property.
