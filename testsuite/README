Tips for the testsuite.
=======================
The testsuite consists of modelica files (.mo) and modelica script files (.mos) in the directories mofiles and mosfiles.

1. make  
   Will make all tests that currently should pass. Use this before checking in.

2. rtest in directory mofiles
   Will run all tests in the directory, including tests that does not pass.

3. make failingtest runs the tests that is added but not in the testsuite since they
  fail, i.e. not implemented in OMC yet.

To get a correct testfile, watch out for use of tab and space, can be hard to find. If rtest fails but the single file actually translates with omc the check the log file in the /tmp directory. 

Templates for writing testfiles are:

mofiles/translation_template.mo
mofiles/translation_failed_template.mo

mosfiles/simulation_template.mos
mosfiles/simulation_failed_template.mos

rtest special directives added to help creating testcases:
* cflags: +d=xyz
  Will insert the text as arguments to omc.
  Useful if you e.g. want to disable compiling functions with gcc while you flatten code.
  You can also set the environment variable RTEST_OMCFLAGS if you want to insert these flags for all commands you run.
* setup_command: gcc ...
  Will execute the provided command before running omc.
* teardown_command: rm -f ...
  Will execute the provided command after running omc.

NOTE:
A test MUST have the finishing "end ..." at the same indentation level as the "model ..." otherwise there will be a warning(perl -w rtest file) for the next test that are executed.
NEVER do this:
// flcass ...
//    ...
//    end flclass ...;

Do this:
// flcass ...
//    ...
// end flclass ...;
Then perl is happy. (no warnings and errornously failed testcases).
