Revision 4084

Added by Adrian Pop, 2010-09-14
Changed: 
- ModelicaServices/package.mo to include dummy functions PackShape and PackMaterial.
- Modelica/Constants.mo
  final constant Integer Integer_inf=2147483647
  to
  final constant Integer Integer_inf=1073741823
  so we get rid of the MetaModelica maxint warning.
