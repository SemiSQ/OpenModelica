02a_exp1 exercise
-----------------


In this exercise you will add new constructs 
to the exp1 language and deal with their evaluation.

ASSIGNMENT: add the following constructs to the language
- a power operator
- a factorial operator
- search for // your code here within exp1.mo

NOTE: the parser/lexer are ready, however the records need to be defined
in the same order as in lexer.l and parser.y

SOLUTION.mo presents the solution to the assignment.

To run the calculator, run "make"
To test our solution, run "make test"
For more details, run "omc +g=MetaModelica +d=failtrace,matchcase SCRIPT.mos"

You need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called program.txt
in order to test the new features you add to the language.
