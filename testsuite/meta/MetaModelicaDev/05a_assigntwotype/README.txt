05a_assigntwotype exercise
--------------------------

ASSIGNMENT:
In this exercise you will:
- add a new String type to the current Exp node which can hold only integers as strings 
- add cases to evaluate expressions and assignments of type "2" + 1 + "1" + 1.0 in the eval function
- search for // your code here within AssignTwoType.mo

OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENT:
- change the code to allow the use of identifiers before actual declaration
  Example: a program of the form: 
		a := b + 1
		b := 3
		;
		a+b
		should return 7 instead of 4 as it returns now  

NOTE: the parser/lexer are ready, but you have to implement the types
before they start parsing STRING properly.

SOLUTION.txt presents the solution to the assignment.

To clean the project type "clean" when building the project.
To build the project leave the input box empty when building the project.
To run the calculator type "run" when building the project.

If you need to edit the input of the calculator edit the file called program.txt
