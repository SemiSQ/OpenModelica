ASSIGNMENT:
In this exercise you will:
- add a new String type to the current Exp node which can hold only integers as strings 
- add cases to evaluate expressions and assignments of type "2" + 1 + "1" + 1.0 in the eval function
- search for // your code here within AssignTwoType.mo

OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENT:
- change the code to allow the use of identifiers before actual declaration
  Example: a program of the form:
