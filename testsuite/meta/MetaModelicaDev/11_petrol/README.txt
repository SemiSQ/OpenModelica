10_petrol exercise
------------------

Additional example exercise implements a compiler for a pascal like language.
The compiler translates the pascal like language to C.

To clean the project type "clean" when building the project.
To build the project leave the input box empty when building the project.
To run the calculator type "run" when building the project.

If you need to edit the input of the petrol translator edit the Makefile.run target.
Right now the Makefile.run target calls the petrol compiler with testd/big.d as input.
There are additional example programs in testd and testp directories.
