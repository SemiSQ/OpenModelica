# This script parses the makefiles in the testsuite and extracts (almost) all
# testcases. It then runs each test with the runtest.pl script, which creates a
# new directory for each test and symlinks all needed files into that directory.
# In this way it's possible to run all tests in parallel, which greatly speeds
# up testing when using more than two processor cores.
#
# Usage: Run without any arguments to run the whole testsuite, or with -f to
#        run a fast test, i.e. skipping the libraries directory.
#
# NOTE: This is not the official OpenModelica way of running the testsuite, so
#       you should run a 'make test' before committing any changes just to make
#       sure that this script doesn't miss anything.
#
# NOTE: This script has only been tested on Linux so far, and will probably not
#       work under any other platform without some modifications.
#
# TODO: MetaModelicaDev in meta is not run yet, since those tests are organized
#       a bit differently.
