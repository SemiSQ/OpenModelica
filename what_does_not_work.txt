This file describes what features are missing
and what known problems there is

General
-------

 * No new features from Modelica 2.0 work


Flattening and type resolution (modeq)
------------------------------

 * You must declare before use
 * Functions can not generally be evaluated compile time
 * External functions does not work
 * Import does not work
 * Within does not work
 * Named arguments does no work
 * Arrays of indeterminate size flaky
   - Due to needs from the code generation of functions
     some checking where removed. Consequences unknown...
 * if equations not supported (then or else must be determined compile time)
 * for loop equations flaky.
 * operators that should take Types of any number of dimensions are
   limited to compiled in number of dimensions (currently 9)
 * same restriction for builtin functions
 * slicing not working
   - slicing means
      record rec Real x; end rec;
      rec[4] recs;
      recs.x = {1,2,3,4};
 * a lot more...


C code generation (modeq)
-----------------

 * Assignement of multiple return values does not work
 * External functions does not work
 * Named arguments does not work
 * Strings does not work
 * Generates lots of array copying
 * Values given to variables in the declaration are ignored
 * Unary minus on arrays
 * pow (a^b)
 * a lot more...


C runtime
----------

 * Integer array functions missing (mostly copy&paste from Real array impl)
 * Similar for Boolean and String arrays
 * a lot more...

modelica_parser
---------------

 * function call with empty parameter list buggy

mosh
-------------

 * cat operator does not work ([a,b,c;d,e,f])
 * for each arguments not supported (sin({1,2,3}))
 * no type checking when calling functions
 * a lot more...
