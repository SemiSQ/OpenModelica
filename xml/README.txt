2004-02-26 ModelicaXML alpha version
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# this version is not stable yet and:

    * some element contents are not yet as they are defined in modelica.dtd.
    * some nonterminals should not appear in the xml file. 

# tested on Modelica base library 1.5.
# packaged with striped down versions of antlr and xerces.
# it works on Windows (VC++ 7.0, GCC-Cygwin), Linux, Solaris
  - with some recompilation of libraries and Makefile hacks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Note:
 - Changes into include/lib inside MSVC++ project are 
   needed to compile this.
 - ANTLR and XercesC++ are needed
